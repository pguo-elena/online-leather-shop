Implementation
This section is installation instructions for Leather Store Project.

Analyzing Requirements: The project should have three parts. Part 1 is showing the picture of the diagram; Part 2 is showing CRUD interface of every table in the database; Part 3 is showing solution to the eight problems. We finally choose PHP + MySQL to deal with database operation and HTML5 + CSS3 to create a nice user interface. We managed the version using GitHub.
Installation: Installed MAMP 3.0 as a local server. Installed Netbeans 8.0.1 as integrated development environment for HTML and PHP. Use phpMyAdmin to manage MySQL database.
Application Development: We worked out main page of Part 3 first using AJAX to updating the page and Mysqli for PHP to communicate with database. Then we rewrite the whole Javascript using jQuery 2.1.4, rewirte HTML and CSS using Bootstrap 3.3.5
Testing:Testing people tried different situation and different input to report bugs and make sure the application runs properly.
Release:Simplify the code and comments, then packaged the project.
